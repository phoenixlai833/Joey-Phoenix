### Step 4: Right click your project folder listed in the Workspace column and select 'Open in Integrated Terminal'
You should be able to see the path of your current directory in the terminal.


üí≠ **NOTE** : The terminal can also be opened by you pressing **[CTRL]** and **[~]** simultaneously. Using 'Open in Integrated Terminal' will automatically set the terminal path to the project directory.

### Step 5: Type `npm init` in the terminal and hit **[Enter]** to run the command
You will see some prompts appear in the terminal. Hit **[Enter]** for each prompt. Once you see the prompt *`Is this OK? (yes)`*, hit **[Enter]** once more. You should see a new file listed in your project directory in the Workspace column called *package.json*.

### Step 6: Type `npm install express` in the terminal and hit **[Enter]** to run the command
You can watch the installation process in the terminal. The installation has succeeded when you see the prompt *`found 0 vulnerabilities`*. You may see some WARNING prompts. Do not worry about these.

### Step 7: Type `npm install ejs express` in the terminal and hit **[Enter]** to run the command
You can watch the installation process in the terminal. The installation has succeeded when you see the prompt *`found 0 vulnerabilities`*. You may see some WARNING prompts. Do not worry about these.

### Step 8: Confirm that the installations have succeeded by checking the *package.json* file
`express.js` and `ejs` should now be listed under `dependencies`.


‚ùó **CAUTION** : Do not delete the package.json file!

#### Congratulations! You have completed Step 1. üöÄ
