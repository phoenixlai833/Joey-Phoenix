# Express.js Basics

Hello! The purpose of this document is to guide you on how to set up a [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/) web application using [**Express.js**](https://expressjs.com/) that works for both Mac and Windows machines. We will divide the fundamentals of how the software works into smaller building blocks that form the basic structure of complex projects.

[**Read the docs**](https://phoenixlai833.github.io/express-documentation-joey-phoenix/)

Topics covered in this document are:

- How to install Express.js
- How the file structure is organized
- Display messages to the browser
- Basic routing methods
- How to use middleware to display static files

## Overview

Express.js is one of the most popular Node.js back-end web application frameworks that was released as a free and open-source software. It provides many useful features to provide server-side logic for web and mobile applications in a simple and flexible way. We will go step by step and focus on the fundamentals of how to set up a basic server and routes. We hope it is easy to follow and useful for people to incorporate into their own applications. 


#### Intended Users
Regardless of where you are in your development journey, this documentation will provide clear guidance on the basic concepts of Express.js. This guide will be particularly useful for:
- Beginner developers that have basic front-end and back-end knowledge.
- Development teams that want to save time on back-end set up.



#### Software Versions
Please have the following installed before proceeding:
- Node.js version 14.17.6 or later
- Visual Studio Code
- Npm Package manager version 6 or later


#### Prerequisites
This document requires the following knowledge: 
- Working knowledge of the Visual Studio Code terminal
- Basic knowledge of Javascript(ES6), HTML, and CSS to create a static web page
- Working knowledge of the Node.js package manager npm


#### Resources

This guide was written with experience from our COMP 2523 Object-Oriented Programming 1 class, as well as references from the official [Express documentation](https://expressjs.com/).


## Conclusion

This was the groups first time writing in markdown for our COMM 2116 Business Communications 2 class. We quickly learned the syntax and focused on being clear and concise in technical writing through this experience. We determined our own typographical conventions and style guide to implement throughout to visually unify and maximize readibilty on the web.

Writing this document allowed us to gain a new skill and solidify our own Express knowledge. We hope that this document is as helpful to you as it is to us. 

#### Happy developing! ðŸš€
